# Only runs in Windows right now
# Client.py or Client.pyw?
Client.py is more of a debug version because it shows the terminal when you open it so choose Client.pyw if you dont want it to be shown

# If you want it to work outside of your local network then edit RevShellServer.py and follow the instructions do the same with Client.pyw
