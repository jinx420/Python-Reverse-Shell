# Python-Reverse-Shell
This is a simple reverse shell in python

#Only runs on Windows yet
#Client.py or Client.pyw?
Client.py is more of a debug version because it shows the terminal when you open it so choose Client.pyw if you dont want it to be shown

#If you want it to work outside of your local network then edit RevshellServer.py and follow the instructions do the same with Client.pyw
